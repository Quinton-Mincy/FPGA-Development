# FPGA-Development
FPGA projects inspired by the lectures and labs of the ECE 5760 course at Cornell

## Summary

I will be working through the labs and lectures, available at [Bruce Lands](https://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece5760/index_old.html) website (senior lecturer at Cornell's University of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Much of the source code I will go over is available there, and I will be
updating it to be compatible with the Cyclone IV FPGA (source code is for Cyclone II) and also providing documentation on how to navigate the new Quartus prime IDE, as the labs I am going through were developed and synthesized with the deprecated Quartus II software.
