# Overview

[DLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion-limited_aggregation) is a process where particles are released in a bounded environment to randomly 
wander around, and whenever they encounter another particle, they stick to it and halt their motion. As this process progresses, 2D fractals known as
[*Brownian Trees*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_tree) emerge.
