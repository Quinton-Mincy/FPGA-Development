## Diffusion Limited Aggregation (DLA) in Verilog: An Introduction to Cellular Automata

# Overview

[DLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion-limited_aggregation) is a process where particles are released in a bounded environment to randomly 
wander around, and whenever they encounter another particle, they stick to it and halt their motion. As this process progresses, 2D fractals known as
*Brownian Trees* emerge.
